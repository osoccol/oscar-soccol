In addition of HTML & CSS I mainly use open-sources technologies.

For the front-end,which is the visual and interactive aspect of websites, I use TypeScript. 
It is built on the most used language on the web: JavaScript.

To TypeScript I associate Angular framework
It's open-source and co-diricted by Google.
I think that it is the future of web applications due to its excellent management of data and events.
I also use Bootstrap in association with Angular, it's a very popular and powerful tool for website designs.
It makes the code lighter and easily maintanable.

For the back-end, which is about managing data and server-side calculi, I program in Java with the framework Spring.
Since 19-95 Java is everywhere and has influenced a large amount of languages.
By mastering it I am able to program in any object oriented language.
Spring framework is perfect to lighten the Java code, especially to configure environments and manage data.

In the next sections I'll talk about my experiences and how I used the technologies that I just described.
