After my engineering academic course I worked during 2 years for HN Services based in Paris.
I followed a 6 months program to teach me the new technologies associated with Java (as Angular/React/Spring and others).

After the training I was part of the team who created from scratch a new solution for the world wide company Elis. 
A massive project that had for objectives to guide the company's drivers at their delivery point, associated with a monitoring and dispatching solution.
We also implemented a program to optimize deliveries.
I also wrote and updated the functional and technical specifications of the application.

The solution was a single page application and has been develop with the following technologies and caracteristics:
Angular for the front-end
Java and Spring for the back-end
It had a micro-services architecture which was deployed on the cloud Azher from Microsoft.
A Postgres database that processed 3M requests/day.
A cartographic monitoring with Here Maps API.

I'm motivated by new projects and putting my efforts into new challenges, technically and professionnally.
