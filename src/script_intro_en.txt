Hi and Welcome, 
My name is Oscar Soccol and I'm a web developer who cares about the quality of my code.
I do my best to fit the principles of green it while giving the best user experience.

I invite you to know more about this subject at the bottom of this page, above the contact section.

In the next sections, I'll talk about the technologies that I use and why I use them,
my experiences,
and my methodology to create apps & websites.

I wish you a good experience on my page and I hope we get in touch very soon.
