Supporting the Greent IT movement, it's acting to reduce the ecological footprint and the social impact of numerical technologies in their whole process.

The Green IT invite to create lighter and easier services.

Go to your electronic mailbox,
delete 10 old mails that wont serve you anymore,

Repeat that on the next day.
